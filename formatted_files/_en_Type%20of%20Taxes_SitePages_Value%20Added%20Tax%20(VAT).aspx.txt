<span>Value Added Tax (VAT)</span></div><div><a><span>​​simplified value added tax (svat) scheme</span></a></div><h3>Value Added Tax​</h3><p>Value Added Tax (VAT) is introduced by the Act No.14 of 2002 and is in force from 1<sup>st</sup> August, 2002. VAT Act replaced the Goods and Services Tax (GST) which was almost similar tax on the consumption of goods and services.</p><p>It is a tax on domestic consumption of goods and services. The goods imported into Sri Lanka and goods and services supplied within the territorial limits of Sri Lanka are the subject matter of this tax. It is a multi-stage tax levied on the incremental Value at every stage in the production and distribution chain of Goods and Services. The tax is borne by the final or the ultimate consumer of Goods or services. It is an indirect tax and the Government will receive at the end, through all the intermediary suppliers in the chain of production and distribution, an amount equal to the amount paid by the final consumer.</p><p>There are certain supplies of goods and services exempt from VAT. (As mentioned in the Part II of the First Schedule of VAT Act)​ </p><p> ​​​
